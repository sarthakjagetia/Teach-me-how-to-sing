We are a team of 4 graduate students trying to make an Android app called **VOCAL** which will teach users how to sing.
We plan to achive the goal by doing real time pitch detection based on *[YIN Pitch Detection Algorithm](http://audition.ens.fr/adc/pdf/2002_JASA_YIN.pdf)* and provide the feedback to the user via a pointer and a background of musical note scale as shown below...

We have also implemented a rudimemtary scoring algorithm which scores users based on how close they were to the reference pitch while singing.
The app has 2 modes: 
1. Exercise mode
2. Song mode

In the Exercise Mode, we expect the user to be an inexperienced singer so that the app will repeatedly give lessons on how to sing untill he is able to sing at the required pitch. The lessons will be short and easy for the ease of training. _Think of it as a Smart Karaoke_. 

In the Song Mode however, the lessons will be long and will include a whole song. Here the user will be graded again based on his singing just like a normal karaoke app.

## Installation
1. From your terminal or command prompt go to the directory where you want to copy the files of the project.
